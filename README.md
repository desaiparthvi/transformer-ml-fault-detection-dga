# Machine Learning Based Transformer Fault Detection using DGA

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to detect and classify transformer faults using Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) data.

## Work Done
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance analysis using classification metrics

## Tools Used
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Status
Model developed. Further improvements and research paper in progress.

## Model Used
The project uses supervised classification techniques to identify transformer fault types based on DGA gas concentration features.

## Future Work
- Model optimization
- Cross-validation improvement
- Research paper submission
